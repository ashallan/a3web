      <img src="images/softwaresolutions.jpg" alt="Software Solutions">
      <p>When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends
         with the little rascals. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. 
         Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. Let's have a happy little tree in here. Just a little indication. This piece of canvas is your world. 
         Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be.</p>

      <h2>Map Design Adrian Koornneef</h2>
      <img src="images/mapdesign.jpg" alt="Map Design">
      <p>We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. You can create anything that makes you happy. 
        Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Just make little strokes like that. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen 
        that lives here. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. This is unplanned it really just happens.</p>

      <p>I thought today we would do a  happy little picture. We'll have a super time. All kinds of happy little splashes. Let the paint work. I guess I'm a little weird. 
        I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Isn't that fantastic?</p>
