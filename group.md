### Website Theme:
"name to be determined" GIS consulting group website.

### Design Considerations:
- "Use consistent and purposeful HTML style
Use the style guide as a base to form your group's defined style. Neatness counts! Adaptations to this style are 
ok but should not violate the basics shown in the guide. If in doubt, ask."
- Layout
  - Typography
    - Usability, readability, accessibility
    - Colours
    - Fonts
- Graphics
- Mobile/Responsive

### Content Considerations:

##### ** Meeting Minutes:
Template components are to be completed prior to next meeting, which will be held on November___. Each item on the assigned component task list 
should be checked off as they are completed. There will be check-ins on incomplete boxes closer to the next meeting to ensure the group timeline 
is on track without any issues. Template components will be added to the master repository after presentations next meeting.


## Meeting 2 Objectives

1. Component presentations.
2. Combine individual components into design template.
  - "The entire group should concentrate on one template page together using the collaborative and 
version control tools built into GIT to work together at the same time."
  - "Copy the template for each target page in your site and as a team fill in the "content", modifying 
the design slightly to adapt to the content on each page."
4. Evaluate coding for errors.
5. Assess quality of design of website layout and make revisions if necessary.
6. Submit template.
7. Schedule next meeting.

##### ** Meeting Minutes:


## Meeting 3 Objectives
1. Determine content of website.
2. Divide and assign content.
    - "filling content and flexing the design to meet the needs of each individual page"
    - "Comments are important in all your code. Your group must use a single owner name for each section in comments. 
All code must be divided up and allocated to only one group member and cannot be shared. Contributions from other 
members are encouraged, but the owner of a code block is the one responsible for its function and how it works with 
all other sections. It is not recommended members' work on individual pages, it is recommended your team divide the 
work into components across all pages and each group member is responsible for that component throughout the site." 
    - "only one group member can "own" that section and is responsible for its functionality irrespective of who modifies it."
    - "All group members to contribute to HTML and CSS
Each group member helps build the entire website. Do not create pages separately--each member should be contributing 
to sections of every page. Perhaps make one member responsible for the menuing system, another for main body layout and 
a third can work on the JavaScript interaction. All members would contribute content for the site as well.
4. Schedule next meeting."
